## Getting Started

This repository contains the code base for the python implementation of the OVNS algorithm, a state-of-the-art performant heuristic for solving the Heaviest k-Subgraph Problem in social networks. 

### Prerequisites

This software has the following dependencies:

- Python (3.9 or newer)
- Numba (0.56 or newer)
- Numpy

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/decitizen/ovns.git
    ```

2. Install Python dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

After installation, you can run the OVNS algorithm on your own social network data.

```python
# Import ovns package
import ovns
import numpy as np

N = 1000                               # Number of nodes in the network 
rng = np.random.default_rng()
A = rng.standard_exponential((N, N))   # Random adjacency matrix carrying the weight information
k = 20                                 # Size of the targeted subgraph

result = OVNS(A, k)

```

## Results and Benchmarks

We have conducted benchmarks in both real-life social networks as well as synthetic networks. Please refer to our paper for a comprehensive explanation and discussion of these results.
